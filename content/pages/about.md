# About me

I am a PhD candidate and Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space 
Science and Technology (FINESST) fellow in the Department of Earth, 
Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS). My research focuses on 
greenhouse gas emissions from northern lakes and wetlands through 
high-resolution mapping. I have used optical and synthetic aperture radar 
(SAR) remote sensing datasets from airborne and UAV campaigns. I have 
conducted hydrologic fieldwork in the Alaskan permafrost, Canadian boreal 
zone, Arizonan Sonoran desert, and the wilds of Connecticut. In addition 
to crunching geospatial data sets, I enjoy jazz piano, vegetable 
gardening, and traveling by bicycle.
